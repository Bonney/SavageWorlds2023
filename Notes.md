# Notes

Character for a Savage Worlds tabletop game campaign in a fantasy setting.

Character is a reluctant wizard, forced to study magic in his free time after his family's long-latent magical abilities manifested.

Character doesn’t want to study spells - he wants to fight like his father and uncles!

Father's family is Human, and from a long line of physical fighters, swordsmen, brutes, mercenaries and the like. Most of the character's uncles, grandfathers, etc have been fighters and mercenaries, and have long worked for the various groups. It's the family business.

Mom comes from a more magical family or bloodline, but her family's magical talents have been dormant for generations, mostly known as a fun thing that great-great-grandma used to be able to do.

The character grew up expecting to follow in the family footsteps; however, when he began to spontaneously show signs of magic in his teens, his mother was estatic, and urged him to study at the local magic academy, to the character's dismay.

Now the character is reluctantly training as a spellcaster, but doesn’t keep up with studies as well as he should. He still likes to take off on mercenary missions whenever possible, fighting alongside friends and the people he knows as family.
