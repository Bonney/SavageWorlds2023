## Background

Drake is a (mostly) human man in his mid twenties, born into a family of renowned physical fighters, with a long lineage of swordsmen, brutes, and mercenaries. However, as he grew up, his mother noticed that he was displaying signs of magical abilities, a trait inherited from her family. Although Drake was not interested in pursuing a career in magic, his mother convinced him to attend the local magic academy to hone his skills.

## Personality

Drake is a reluctant wizard who yearns for the physical prowess of his family. He often feels out of place at the magic academy and prefers to spend his time fighting alongside his friends and family. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will do whatever it takes to protect them.

# History

Growing up, Drake idolized his father and uncles and dreamed of becoming a physical fighter like them. However, as he entered his teens, he began to display magical abilities, much to his dismay. His mother, who came from a magical family, was overjoyed at the news and urged him to attend the local magic academy.

Despite his reluctance, Drake attended the academy and began studying magic. However, he struggled to keep up with his studies and often skipped classes to go on mercenary missions with his family and friends. Drake found solace in the thrill of battle and often felt out of place at the academy.

Now, as a novice wizard, Drake continues to train in magic while also taking on mercenary missions whenever possible. He is torn between his desire to please his mother and his longing for the physicality of his family's trade. Drake knows he must find a way to reconcile these two parts of his identity if he is to find true fulfillment in life.

## Skills

Despite his lack of interest in magic, Drake has still managed to pick up a few spells and has a basic understanding of magical theory. He is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and is proficient with a sword. Drake also has experience working as a mercenary and has developed skills in tracking, survival, and negotiation.
