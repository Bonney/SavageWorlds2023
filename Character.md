Kaelin's mother was determined to see her son hone his magical abilities, and so she sent him to a prestigious college on the eastern side of the continent. Kaelin spent a year there studying magic, but he struggled to adapt to the new environment and often found himself longing for home. Now, he is back for a "year abroad," and his uncle, who shares his mother's magical traits, has been tasked with keeping Kaelin sharp. Kaelin's uncle works for the local mercenary guild and is always ready for an adventure. Kaelin is excited to be home and back in the thick of things, but he knows that his uncle's zany ways will keep him on his toes.
