# Notes

Overall motivation is a reluctant hero, except he’s a wizard. Character doesn’t want to study spells - he wants to fight like his father and uncles!

Fathers family is human, a long line of physical fighters, swordsmen, brutes, mercenaries, etc. 
most of family works with the various mercenary guilds 
- Mom comes from a more magical family or bloodline, but with very little magical ability due to mixing with non magic blood. 

Character has assumed they’d be a mercenary as well. Trained all their life. No signs of magic in his family for generations 

Surprise when he one day showed signs of magic around puberty age!

Mom asked him to train with the local magic guild

- Character is reluctantly training as a spellcaster, but doesn’t keep up with studies and takes off on mercenary missions whenever possible 

- Story-wise, you’re part of a larger mercenary group that’s been hired by the king to seek out certain enemy encampments
