## Background

Kaelin is a (mostly) human man in his mid twenties, born into a family of renowned physical fighters, with a long lineage of swordsmen, brutes, and mercenaries. However, as he grew up, his mother noticed that he was displaying signs of magical abilities, a trait inherited from her family. Although Kaelin was not interested in pursuing a career in magic, his mother convinced him to attend the local magic academy to hone his skills.

## Personality

Kaelin is a reluctant wizard who yearns for the physical prowess of his family. He often feels out of place at the magic academy and prefers to spend his time fighting alongside his friends and family. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will do whatever it takes to protect them.

## History

Growing up, Kaelin idolized his father and uncles and dreamed of becoming a physical fighter like them. However, as he entered his teens, he began to display magical abilities, much to his dismay. His mother, who came from a magical family, was overjoyed at the news and urged him to attend the local magic academy.

Kaelin's mother was determined to see her son hone his magical abilities, and so she sent him to a prestigious college on the eastern side of the continent. Kaelin spent a year there studying magic, but he struggled to adapt to the new environment and often found himself longing for home. Now, he is back for a "year abroad," and his uncle, who shares his mother's magical traits, has been tasked with keeping Kaelin sharp. Kaelin's uncle works for the local mercenary guild and is always ready for an adventure. Kaelin is excited to be home and back in the thick of things, but he knows that his uncle's zany ways will keep him on his toes.

## Skills

Despite his lack of interest in magic, Kaelin has still managed to pick up a few spells and has a basic understanding of magical theory. He is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and is proficient with a sword. Kaelin also has experience working as a mercenary and has developed skills in tracking, survival, and negotiation.

## Family

### Athena

Kaelin's mother, Althea, comes from a family with a long and storied history of magical ability. However, for several generations, the magic in their bloodline had not manifested, and Althea herself had almost no magical talent to speak of. Despite this, Althea remained fascinated by magic and studied it extensively throughout her youth.

When Kaelin began showing signs of magical ability, Althea was overjoyed. She saw in him the potential to carry on their family's magical legacy, and urged her son to persue magic and learn everything he could.

###  Uncle Jerek

Kaelin's uncle, Jarek, was always the black sheep of the family. He inherited his mother's magical abilities but never had much interest in pursuing a career in magic. Instead, he became a mercenary and joined the local guild, where he quickly gained a reputation for being one of the most daring and unpredictable fighters in the region.

Jarek is a charismatic and outgoing man, with a quick wit and an irreverent sense of humor. He has a knack for getting himself and others into trouble, but he always manages to come out on top. Jarek is fiercely loyal to his family and friends, but he has a devil-may-care attitude that sometimes makes him difficult to trust.

Despite his reputation for being a wild card, Jarek is a skilled fighter and a competent mage. He has a deep knowledge of magical theory and can cast a variety of spells with ease. However, he prefers to rely on his physical prowess and often eschews magic in favor of his trusty sword. Jarek sees himself as a free spirit, unbound by rules or restrictions, and he encourages Kaelin to embrace his own rebellious streak.
