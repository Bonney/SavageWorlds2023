- This is my Savage Worlds character, Kaelin Hillcrest. Create a etheral/magical/spritely companion creature he may learn to conjure.
- [pasted in character bio; cut here for length]

How about a pixie as Kaelin's companion creature? Pixies are spritely and magical creatures that are known for their mischievousness and playfulness.

As Kaelin is a reluctant wizard, having a companion creature that is fun-loving and lively could help to lighten his mood and make him more comfortable with his magical abilities. The pixie could also be an excellent asset in combat, using its agility and small size to evade attacks and distract opponents.

In terms of appearance, the pixie could have shimmering, translucent wings that reflect the colors of the rainbow. Its body could be small and delicate, with pointed ears and a mischievous grin. Its magical abilities could include the power of illusion and the ability to create small bursts of magical energy, making it an unpredictable and formidable ally.

As Kaelin becomes more comfortable with his magical abilities, he may learn to conjure the pixie at will and use its unique powers to enhance his combat skills and protect those he cares about.

- Can you develop it in to more of a sprite? It should look like a glowing ball.

Certainly! As a sprite, Kaelin's companion creature could take on a more ethereal appearance, resembling a glowing ball of light with wings. Its body could be transparent and shimmering, emitting a soft and warm glow that illuminates the area around it.

The sprite could be an embodiment of elemental magic, with its power tied to the natural world. It could have the ability to manipulate and control the elements of nature, such as creating gusts of wind, summoning vines, or conjuring small rainstorms. Its small size and quick speed would make it an ideal scout and messenger, darting through the air with ease and agility.

As Kaelin learns to conjure the sprite, he may discover that it is also capable of providing him with a boost in his own magical abilities. When working in harmony with the sprite, Kaelin may find that he can cast spells with greater ease and precision, as if the sprite is amplifying his own magical energy.

Overall, the sprite companion would be an excellent ally for Kaelin, helping him to embrace his magical abilities while also providing a fun and energetic presence.
