# Character

Name: [Insert Name Here]
Race: Human with elven ancestry
Background: [Insert Name Here] was born into a family of physical fighters and mercenaries, and he trained his whole life to follow in their footsteps. He assumed he would become a mercenary like his father and uncles, and he spent most of his time training with swords, shields, and other weapons.
However, everything changed when he suddenly showed signs of magical ability around puberty age. [Insert Name Here] was surprised and didn't want to accept that he was a spellcaster, feeling like he was betraying his family's legacy of physical combat.
Despite his reluctance, [Insert Name Here]'s mother, who comes from a more magical bloodline, urged him to hone his talent at the local magic guild. [Insert Name Here] agreed to give it a try, but he quickly found that he didn't enjoy studying spells and would much rather be out on mercenary missions.
Now, [Insert Name Here] is a reluctant hero, torn between his love of fighting and his growing fascination with magic. He uses his spells to support his allies and weaken his enemies, but he always feels like he's cheating somehow.
